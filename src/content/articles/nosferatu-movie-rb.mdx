Robert Eggers' reimagining of the classic vampire tale "Nosferatu" brings a fresh perspective to F.W. Murnau's 1922 masterpiece. The film showcases Eggers' distinctive cinematographic style, blending period authenticity with modern filmmaking techniques.

The visual composition draws heavily from German Expressionism, much like its predecessor, while incorporating Eggers' signature attention to historical detail and atmospheric lighting. The film's cinematography creates a palpable sense of dread and supernatural presence, perfectly capturing the essence of the vampire myth.

## Lighting Techniques

Eggers utilizes natural light sources wherever possible, creating an authentic period feel. Candlelight and shadow play a crucial role in establishing the film's eerie atmosphere, with each frame meticulously composed to maximize tension and visual impact.

## Camera Movement

Unlike many modern horror films that rely on quick cuts and shaky cam techniques, Eggers employs deliberate, measured camera movements. Slow tracking shots and carefully choreographed sequences allow the audience to absorb the detailed production design while building suspense.

## Color Palette

The film's desaturated color palette evokes the monochromatic look of the original 1922 film while adding subtle tonal variations that enhance the storytelling. Eggers' use of contrast between light and shadow creates a visual language that speaks to the film's themes of life, death, and the supernatural.
